# I'm Quant Theodore Felix

> [Korean README](https://github.com/Quant-TheodoreFelix/Quant-TheodoreFelix/blob/main/README.md)

I am a member of Team **Quant**, which is redefining the paradigm of security in response to the advancement of information and communication technology and the rise of quantum computing.

I focus on building future-oriented security solutions by combining high-performance backend architecture design with research on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms.

Although I belong to a team, I could also be described as quite a solitary developer...

## Areas of Expertise & Core Competencies

* **Quantum Security & Cryptography**: Practical implementation and optimization of next-generation post-quantum cryptography algorithms such as ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA.
* **System Engineering**: High-performance server development in Java 21+ environments and creation of memory-safe native libraries utilizing Rust.
* **Advanced Interoperability**: Efficient integration between Java and native layers via the Java Linker API (Foreign Function & Memory API).
* **Data Analysis-Based Business**: Establishment of data-driven personal business models through the construction of short-form and long-form content trend analysis platforms.

## Major Projects

I am diligently creating security tools such as [Entanglement Library](https://github.com/Quant-Off/entanglementlib) and [Poseidon](https://github.com/Quant-Off/poseidon). Beyond information security, I also build web applications (though I don't have much design sense). I frequently develop convenience items helpful to the general public (people whose main profession is not computer-related), as well as small utilities perfect for developers or content creators.

~~*I haven't organized everything yet, but...*~~ You can refer to https://docs.qu4nt.space/en/docs/projects for my major projects.

## Tech Stack

I primarily work with Java and Rust languages.

## Technical Philosophy

In every stage of system development, I prioritize **top-level security capabilities** and **stability & performance** as the highest values. In any case, I prioritize 'stability' over 'convenience'.

I particularly aim for code that ensures memory efficiency and thread safety. Although it is a strength that has been pushed to second place due to my belief in security as the number one priority, I am convinced that this is an essential virtue in precise fields such as quantum security.

Currently, I am operating a business model to provide high-security quantum technology solutions derived from `EntanglementLib` to enterprises, governments, and military institutions, and I am building an ecosystem where technical excellence leads to trust.
